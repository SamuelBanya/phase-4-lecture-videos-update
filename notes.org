* Notes
I made the following revision to the 'app/controllers/productions_controller.rb' file:
#+begin_src ruby
class ProductionsController < ApplicationController
    # NOTE: This is added to wrap the 'params' hash below:
    wrap_parameters format: []
    def index
        productions = Production.all()
        render json: productions, status: :ok
    end

    def show
        production = Production.find_by(id: params[:id])

        if production
            render json: production, status: :ok
        else
            render json: {error: "production not found"}, status: :not_found
        end
    end

    def create
        # NOTE: I revised this line to instead use 'production_params' from the private method below:
        # production = Production.create(params)
        production = Production.create(production_params)
        render json: production, status: :created
    end

    def update
    end

    private

    # NOTE: This private method ONLY allows these parameter values to come inside these 'production_params'
    def production_params
        params.permit(:title, :genre, :budget, :image, :director, :ongoing, :description)
    end
end
#+end_src

I then adjusted the 'app/config/routes.rb' routes file with the following changes:
#+begin_src ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  resources :crew_members
  # resources :productions, only: [:index, :show]
  resources :productions, only: [:index, :show, :create, :update]
  # Define your application routes per the DSL in https://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html

  # Defines the root path route ("/")
  # root "articles#index"
end
#+end_src

I then returned to the 'app/controllers/productions_controller.rb' controller file and added the following revision to the 'update' method:
#+begin_src ruby
class ProductionsController < ApplicationController
    # NOTE: This is added to wrap the 'params' hash below:
    wrap_parameters format: []
    def index
        productions = Production.all()
        render json: productions, status: :ok
    end

    def show
        production = Production.find_by(id: params[:id])

        if production
            render json: production, status: :ok
        else
            render json: {error: "production not found"}, status: :not_found
        end
    end

    def create
        # NOTE: I revised this line to instead use 'production_params' from the private method below:
        # production = Production.create(params)
        production = Production.create(production_params)
        render json: production, status: :created
    end

    def update
        # find
        production = Production.find_by(id: params[:id])
        # update
        if production
            production.update(production_params)
            render json: production, status: :accepted
        else
            render json: { error: "Production not found" }, status: :not_found
        end
    end

    private

    # NOTE: This private method ONLY allows these parameter values to come inside these 'production_params'
    def production_params
        params.permit(:title, :genre, :budget, :image, :director, :ongoing, :description)
    end
end
#+end_src

I ran the 'rails s' server command, and I then went to Postman and made the following request to revise the value 'description' symbol with a related 'PATCH' request:
- HTTP Verb Used: PATCH
- URL Used: http://localhost:3000/productions/10
- Body > raw > JSON:
#+begin_src json
{
    "title": "The Lion King",
    "genre": "Musical",
    "budget": "45000000",
    "image": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lion_King_(musical)#/media/File:The_Lion_King_Musical.svg",

}
#+end_src

I then received the following successful response:
